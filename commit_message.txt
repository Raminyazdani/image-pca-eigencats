Ramin Yazdani | Image PCA & Eigencats | main | WIP(utils): Implement plot_cats visualization function

Implemented plot_cats() utility function for grid visualization of cat faces.

Function features:
- Takes array of cat face images
- Displays them in a customizable grid layout
- Handles grayscale rendering with proper colormaps
- Removes axes for cleaner visualization

This utility will be essential for visualizing mean cats, eigencats,
and reconstructed images throughout the analysis.

Why: Building visualization tools first makes debugging and verification easier.
Verified: Function defined in notebook and produces matplotlib grid layouts.
