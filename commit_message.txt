Ramin Yazdani | Image PCA & Eigencats | main | WIP(bugfix): Fix axis parameter in SVD mean calculation

Fixed critical bug in SVD preprocessing.

Changed: cats.mean(axis=1) → cats.mean(axis=0)

The bug was causing mean to be computed along the wrong dimension:
- axis=1 computes mean within each 64x64 image (wrong!)
- axis=0 computes mean across all 80 images (correct!)

Discovered when reconstructed images looked distorted and didn't
match EVD results. Traced through the math and found the axis error.

Why: This is a common NumPy mistake with multi-dimensional arrays.
Verified: SVD now produces identical results to EVD approach.
