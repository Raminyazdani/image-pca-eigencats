Ramin Yazdani | Image PCA & Eigencats | main | WIP(docs): Initial commit with basic README

Created initial repository with a basic README outlining the project goals.
This is the foundation for a PCA analysis project on cat face images.

The README provides a high-level overview of what the project will accomplish:
applying Principal Component Analysis to extract eigenfaces (eigencats) from
a dataset of cat face images.

Why: Every project needs a clear starting point and project description.
Verified: README.md exists and contains project description.
