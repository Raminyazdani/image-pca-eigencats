Ramin Yazdani | Image PCA & Eigencats | main | WIP(analysis): Add code to visualize eigencats from EVD

Added visualization code to display eigencats computed via EVD.

Features:
- Loads placeholder cat data
- Calls eigencats_evd() to compute principal components
- Visualizes first 4 eigencats in a grid
- Displays variance contribution of each component

The visualization shows the principal "directions" of variation in the
cat face dataset - these are the eigencats that capture different
facial features.

Why: Visualization confirms the EVD implementation works correctly.
Verified: Code produces grid of 4 eigencat visualizations.
