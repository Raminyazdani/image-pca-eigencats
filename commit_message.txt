Ramin Yazdani | Image PCA & Eigencats | main | WIP(pca): Add preprocessing function for mean-centering data

Implemented preprocess() function for mean-centering image data.

Function features:
- Computes mean face across all images
- Subtracts mean from each image (centering)
- Flattens 2D images into 1D vectors
- Returns centered vectors ready for PCA

Mean-centering is essential for PCA as it ensures the first principal
component captures maximum variance rather than just the mean.

Why: Preprocessing is a critical step before eigendecomposition.
Verified: Function produces mean-centered flattened vectors with correct shapes.
