Ramin Yazdani | Image PCA & Eigencats | main | WIP(utils): Implement eigenvector sorting utility

Implemented sort_eigvectors() utility to order eigenvectors by eigenvalues.

Function features:
- Sorts eigenvalues in descending order
- Reorders corresponding eigenvectors to match
- Essential for PCA to select principal components by importance

This utility ensures we always work with eigenvectors ordered by their
contribution to variance, which is crucial for dimensionality reduction.

Why: Eigenvectors must be ordered by eigenvalue magnitude for proper PCA.
Verified: Function correctly sorts and returns ordered eigenvectors.
