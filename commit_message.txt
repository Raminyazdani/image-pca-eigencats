Ramin Yazdani | Image PCA & Eigencats | main | WIP(config): Add .gitignore and requirements.txt

Added project configuration files for proper Python project setup.

Created .gitignore to exclude:
- Python bytecode and cache files (__pycache__, *.pyc)
- Jupyter notebook checkpoints (.ipynb_checkpoints)
- Virtual environments (venv/, env/)
- IDE configuration files

Created requirements.txt with core dependencies:
- numpy>=1.21.0 for linear algebra operations
- matplotlib>=3.3.0 for visualization
- jupyter>=1.0.0 for interactive notebook environment

Why: Proper project hygiene from the start prevents committing unwanted files.
Verified: Both files exist and contain appropriate patterns/dependencies.
