Ramin Yazdani | Image PCA & Eigencats | main | WIP(notebook): Initialize Jupyter notebook with imports and structure

Created eigencats.ipynb with basic structure and imports.

Added initial cells with:
- Title and introduction markdown
- Import statements (numpy, matplotlib)
- Basic notebook configuration (matplotlib inline)

The notebook structure is ready for implementing PCA functions.

Why: Setting up the development environment before writing algorithms.
Verified: Notebook exists and is a valid JSON structure with initial cells.
