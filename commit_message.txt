Ramin Yazdani | Image PCA & Eigencats | main | WIP(data): Integrate cat face dataset

Added the cat face dataset as a NumPy binary file.

Dataset specifications:
- 80 grayscale cat face images
- Each image is 64x64 pixels
- Stored as numpy array in cats.npy
- Data type: float64, values in [0, 255] range

Updated notebook code to load actual data from cats.npy instead
of using placeholder/synthetic data. All visualizations now use
real cat faces.

Why: Real data makes the analysis meaningful and verifiable.
Verified: cats.npy loads successfully with shape (80, 64, 64).
