Ramin Yazdani | Image PCA & Eigencats | main | WIP(analysis): Add comprehensive reconstruction visualization and analysis

Enhanced the reconstruction section with better analysis and visualization.

Added features:
- Comparison grids showing original vs reconstructed images
- Reconstruction with 10, 40, and 80 components
- Visual demonstration of compression trade-offs
- Markdown explaining quality vs dimensionality reduction

The visualizations clearly show how increasing components improves
reconstruction quality, demonstrating the fundamental trade-off
in dimensionality reduction.

Why: Comprehensive visualization helps communicate PCA concepts.
Verified: Multiple comparison grids display reconstruction quality.
