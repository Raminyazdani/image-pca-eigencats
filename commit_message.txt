Ramin Yazdani | Image PCA & Eigencats | main | WIP(reconstruction): Implement image reconstruction [contains axis bug]

Added image reconstruction functionality using eigencats.

Implemented reconstruct_cats() function to:
- Project images onto principal components
- Reconstruct using varying numbers of components
- Demonstrate dimensionality reduction

However, introduced a subtle bug in the SVD preprocessing:
used cats.mean(axis=1) instead of cats.mean(axis=0).
This computes mean within each image instead of across images,
causing incorrect mean-centering.

Why: Reconstruction shows the power of PCA for compression.
Bug: Wrong axis in mean calculation - a common NumPy mistake.
Verified: Function exists but will produce distorted results.
