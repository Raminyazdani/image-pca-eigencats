Ramin Yazdani | Image PCA & Eigencats | main | WIP(docs): Add reference visualization images

Added reference images showing expected outputs.

Created imgs/ directory with:
- meancat.png: Expected mean cat face visualization
- eigencats.png: Expected eigencat components

These reference images serve as:
- Documentation of expected outputs
- Verification that implementation produces correct results
- Visual examples for README and project showcase

Why: Reference images help users verify their results.
Verified: Both PNG files exist in imgs/ directory.
