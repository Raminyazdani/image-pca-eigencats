TRACE	eigencats.ipynb	cell[9] (markdown)	First, calculate the average... After preprocessing, your dataset should contain 80 4096-dimensional vectors.	Calculate the average of all cat images to find the mean cat, then mean-center the dataset. Finally, flatten each image into a vector, resulting in 80 4096-dimensional vectors.	Reframe from instruction-style to descriptive narrative	APPLIED
TRACE	eigencats.ipynb	cell[12] (markdown)	Compute the covariance matrix... You can use sort_eigvectors to do the sorting. Afterwards, plot the first four eigencats.	The covariance matrix is computed using the formula... Eigenvectors are sorted in descending order by eigenvalues, and the first four eigencats are visualized.	Change imperative instructions to descriptive past/present tense	APPLIED
TRACE	eigencats.ipynb	cell[16] (markdown)	Complete eigencats_svd by computing a singular value decomposition	This section computes eigencats using singular value decomposition	Remove assignment-style "complete the function" language	APPLIED
TRACE	eigencats.ipynb	cell[20] (markdown)	Reconstruct the cats... Plot the first four cats... What do you notice?	This section reconstructs cat faces using varying numbers of singular values (10, 40, and 80) to demonstrate dimensionality reduction effects.	Remove question prompt and reframe as descriptive	APPLIED
TRACE	eigencats.ipynb	cell[22] (markdown)	**Question:** Why are the results of the EVD and SVD approaches equivalent? <br> - The results of EVD...	The EVD and SVD approaches produce equivalent results because... (restructured from Q&A to explanatory prose)	Remove assignment question format; reframe as explanatory section	APPLIED
